If you are new in Godot Engine we recommend you to see a few videos in [this site](https://towi.thinkific.com/) just to know how to create a new project.

## Project Structure

### Assets

This folder contains the UI material you can use like a grid with many button icons, the panel asset, a purple button asset, a star asset and the NunitoFont to create a standard with the text.

### Editor

The Editor folder contains 1 .gd script and an icon.
The script is GameUICreator and contains many functions to create the User Interface. It is designed to make the process easier to make a canva or configure the camera for a 2D game.

### Runtime

Runtime is the folder with more scripts to help in the development process. The folder contains 5 .gd scripts.

- The first one is GameResultPanel, it works to create a Result Panel when the player finishes a game. It contains one function called ShowCalification and extends from Towi Enums.
- The second script is Towi Enum. It contains two enums to get and set variables. The first enums corresponds to GamePhase, and the second one to GameResult
- The third script is TowiGameManger. Here you can set variables as GameName, rounds, score and many texts. The idea is that you create a unique GameManger that extends form TowiGameManger.
- The fourth script is TowiMath, only contains the GetResult function that helps to set a score for a game. It extends from TowiEnums
- The fifth script and last one script is TowiUtils, it extends from a Spatial Node and only contains de GetScreenSize function.
